# StrayCare - Google Solution Challenge - 2023 

StrayCare is designed to create a stray animal's friendly community! 

With this app, we aim to bridge the gap between animal lovers and stray animals in need. 

- The app is simple and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to create a profile and get started. Once you've joined the community, you can browse through profiles of stray animals that are up for adoption. 

- These profiles include pictures, a brief description of the animal, and the location where it is. In addition to adoption, our app also provides a feature to put a stray animal for adoption. 

- We believe that it's important for stray animals to receive the necessary care and attention they need, and we provide resources to make it easy for animal lovers to do so. One way by which users can do so is by vaccinating a stray animal and then uploading the medical records of the animal on our app. One of the unique features of our app is the ability to network with other animal lovers in your community.

- We also have a feature that allows users to report stray animals in need of assistance. If you come across a stray animal that needs help, simply take a picture and report it through the app. 

Overall, our app is the perfect tool for anyone who loves animals and wants to make a positive impact in their community. By providing resources for adoption, vaccination, and posting about stray animals, StrayCare is developed to create a world where all animals receive the love and care they deserve.

## Identifying the Problem

- There are several problems associated with the lives of stray dogs in India. These dogs are often neglected and left to fend for themselves, leading to a range of health and behavioral issues. Here are some of the key issues:

- Lack of proper food and shelter: Stray dogs in India often struggle to find enough food to eat and a safe place to rest. This can lead to malnourishment and exposure to harsh weather conditions.

- Health issues: Stray dogs are at risk of contracting diseases such as rabies, distemper, and parvovirus. Without proper medical care, these diseases can lead to serious health problems and even death.

- Overpopulation: Stray dogs often breed uncontrollably, leading to an overpopulation problem. This can lead to increased competition for resources and the spread of diseases.

- Aggressive behavior: Some stray dogs may become aggressive towards humans and other animals, posing a risk to public safety.

- Lack of vaccination: Stray dogs in India are often not vaccinated against diseases such as rabies, which can be transmitted to humans through bites. This can lead to serious health consequences and even death if left untreated.

Overall, the lives of stray dogs in India are characterized by neglect and a range of health and behavioral issues. It is important for governments and individuals to take steps to address these issues, including providing food and shelter, medical care, and vaccination programs to help reduce the spread of diseases like rabies.
