- Overall, our app is the perfect tool for anyone who loves animals and wants to make a positive impact in their community. By providing resources for adoption, vaccination, and posting about stray animals, StrayCare is developed to create a world where all animals receive the love and care they deserve.

## Identifying the Problem

Stray dogs are a significant problem in India, with an estimated population of around **30 million**. These dogs are often neglected and left to fend for themselves, leading to a range of health and behavioral issues. These dogs can pose a variety of issues, including the risk of rabies and the lack of proper care.

According to a survey conducted in 2020 by the National Institute of Animal Welfare, there are around **69,000** stray dogs in Delhi alone. Similarly, in Mumbai, there are around **95,000** stray dogs, according to a survey conducted in 2015. These numbers illustrate the magnitude of the problem and the need for effective solutions.


- **Lack of proper food and shelter**: Another issue with stray dogs in India is the problem of no care. These animals often lack access to proper food, water, and shelter, and they are vulnerable to a range of health issues and diseases. Additionally, stray dogs may pose a threat to public safety by attacking people, particularly children.

- **Risk of rabies**: Rabies is a deadly viral disease that can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected animal, such as a dog. In India, around 17.4 million people are bitten by dogs each year, with over 20,000 deaths due to rabies annually. Stray dogs are a significant contributor to these statistics, as they are more likely to carry the virus due to their lack of vaccinations and medical care.

The features and abilities of StrayCare are as follows:

- **Adopt**: The user can upload the photo of a stray animal that they see around them, along with the location and a brief description of the animal. Another user can now scroll through the feed or go to the "Put up for Adoption" section, where they can find and adopt the animal.

- **Vaccination**: Let's consider a scenario where the user wants to vaccinate a dog that they see nearby. Through our app, user can upload the image of the animal along with the proof that they are vaccinated and the location where the animal is present.

- **Feed**: Every user will have a feed of posts posted by other users, including the updates regarding adoption and vaccination.
